Javascript 15 tile puzzle
You know what I'm talking about.  The little plastic puzzles you might find at the $1 store or in the little grab bags you used to get at birthday parties.  Slide the little tiles around by clicking on them until you get them in order from 1 to 15.

Work that might be done to this to make it more awesome:
* Add a function that implements a counter to keep track of moves.
* Add a function that keeps track of the high (or rather, low) score.
* Figure out how to add better texture to the tiles
* Animate the tiles so they slide rather than merely switch positions with the blank space.
